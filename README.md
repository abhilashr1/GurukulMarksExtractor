# GurukulMarksExtractor
A Python Scrapper to extract marks from My-Gurukul Portal

###Requirements
There are a few things required. Pip should take care of these

1. pip install selenium
2. pip install pyvirtualdisplay
3. pip install bs4

Note: Your OS needs to have Xvfb installed to have a virtual display so as to avoid a constantly closing and reopening browser.

For arch, the command is 
> sudo pacman -S Xvfb
